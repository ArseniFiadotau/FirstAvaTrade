This project is a POC of QA Automation C# Appium for Android testing.

The goal of project is to test android app AvaTrade from Google Play.

Setup:
1. Appium should be installed in the system;
2. Visual Studio should be installed with Android SDK component;
3. Android emulator should be configured. I used Google Pixel 7 with RAM increased to 3 GB (but it's better to use real device, because emulator in my case worked not so stable);
4. App AvaTrade should be installed on Device and its icon should be on main (home) screen;
5. Appium server should be started and android emulator / device should be turned on and available for interactions;
6. Open VS, build solution and run RegistrationTest.

Documents:
1. 3 task.txt - explanation the difference between different registration processes
2. TestPlan.docx - Word documnt with Test plan and testcases for registration flow
3. TestPlan.pdf - PDF version of Test Plan

TODOs:
1. Complete registration test for user with additional education logic;
2. Go through each TODO section in project and make changes or comments when it will be implemented;
3. Add docs for methods.
